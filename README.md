# Ada Course Exercises

Documenting my Ada programming language learning journey through practical exercises and examples.

## Overview

This repository contains various exercises and practice projects as I learn the Ada programming language. Ada is a structured, statically typed, imperative programming language known for its strong typing, reliability, and use in safety-critical systems.

## Projects

### inoutparameters
An exercise exploring Ada's parameter modes (in, out, in out) and how they affect data flow in procedures and functions.

**Technologies:**
- Ada (GNAT compiler)
- Alire (Ada package manager)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GNAT Ada compiler
- Alire (Ada package manager)

### Running the Exercises

Navigate to any exercise directory and use Alire to build and run:

```bash
cd inoutparameters
alr build
alr run
```
